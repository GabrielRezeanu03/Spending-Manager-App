Managed to recreate a spending manager web application using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The Spending Manager allows users to track their income and expenses, providing a clear overview of their financial transactions. Users can add new transactions, view their balance, and see detailed income and expense summaries.

Technologies/Techniques Used:

➢ React.js: Utilized React.js to build the frontend of the application, providing a responsive and interactive user experience.

➢ Context API: Implemented global state management using the Context API to efficiently manage application-wide data such as transactions.

➢ Reducer Pattern: Implemented a reducer pattern for managing state changes, ensuring predictable and maintainable state management.

➢ CSS: Styled the application using CSS to create a clean and intuitive user interface.

➢ GitHub: Hosted the project on GitHub, facilitating collaboration and version control.
